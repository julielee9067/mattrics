Steps for Layout
1. PCB rule set
2. Set up stackup
3. Placement
3.1 arrange components off board
	- keep analog devices far away from digitals signals
        - by pass capacitors and low pass filters should be places as close as humanely possible to the pin they are filtering for
	- leave at least 5 mm clearance form the PCB
	- try to keep as many parts as possible on the top layer, if not possible we will get two stencils

4. Routing
5. silkscreen
